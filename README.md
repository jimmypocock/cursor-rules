# Cursor Rules for AWS Serverless & Modern Applications

A comprehensive set of rules and best practices for the Cursor IDE to guide AI-assisted development of serverless applications, web frontends, and mobile apps.

## Quick Installation

Add these rules to your existing project with a single command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimmypocock/cursor-rules/main/install.sh | bash
```

This will download and install only the necessary rule files into your project's `.cursor/rules` directory.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of configuration files for [Cursor IDE](https://cursor.sh/) that provides context-specific guidance to the AI assistant. These rules help ensure that all code generated by the AI follows consistent patterns, best practices, and architectural principles across your projects.

## Key Components

1. **Base Rules** - Core development principles that apply across all projects, including coding conventions, error handling, and security best practices.

2. **TypeScript Rules** - Specific guidelines for TypeScript development, including type definitions, modern features, and organization patterns.

3. **AWS Serverless Rules**:
   - **Lambda Functions** - Best practices for design, performance, cold start mitigation, and error handling
   - **DynamoDB** - Data modeling principles, key design, query optimization, and cost efficiency
   - **IAM** - Security best practices, least privilege principles, and role design
   - **CloudFormation/SAM** - Infrastructure as code patterns and deployment practices
   - **GameLift** - Game server integration, matchmaking, and fleet management
   - **Bedrock** - Foundation model integration, prompt engineering, and agent design
   - **SageMaker** - ML pipeline design, model deployment, and monitoring
   - **VPC** - Network architecture, security, and connectivity patterns
   - **EventBridge** - Event-driven design, rule configuration, and integration patterns

4. **Web Development Rules**:
   - **Next.js** - App Router architecture, component design, data fetching, and performance optimization
   - **React** - Component patterns, hooks usage, state management, and performance optimization

5. **Mobile Development Rules**:
   - **React Native** - Project setup, component architecture, navigation, and performance optimization
   - **Expo** - Expo ecosystem integration, EAS services, and deployment strategies

6. **Supporting Tools**:
   - Installation script for easy adoption
   - GitHub workflow for automated maintenance
   - Validation tools to ensure rule quality
   - Best practice checkers to keep rules updated
   - Comprehensive documentation

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Rules for all major aspects of modern application development
- **Modularity**: Each rule file focuses on a specific technology or concept
- **Maintainability**: Clear organization makes rules easy to update as best practices evolve
- **Automation**: Tools to validate and distribute rules across projects
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Captures expert knowledge in a format that benefits the entire team

## Implementation Details

The rules follow the modern MDC (Markdown Configuration) format introduced in Cursor v0.45+, which allows:

1. **Domain-specific configurations** targeting specific file patterns
2. **Hierarchical rule inheritance** with base rules extended by more specialized ones
3. **Agent-centric instructions** treating the AI as a specialized coding assistant

## Installation Options

### Option 1: One-Line Installation (Recommended)

The easiest way to add these rules to your project is using our installation script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimmypocock/cursor-rules/main/install.sh | bash
```

This script will:
- Download only the necessary rule files
- Create a `.cursor/rules` directory in your project if it doesn't exist
- Copy the rules into your project
- Clean up any temporary files
- Detect your project type and provide feedback

### Option 2: Manual Installation

If you prefer a manual approach:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jimmypocock/cursor-rules.git
   ```

2. Copy the rules directory to your project:
   ```bash
   cp -r cursor-rules/.cursor/rules your-project/.cursor/
   ```

3. Open your project in Cursor IDE.

## Customizing Rules

These rules are designed to be a starting point. You should customize them to match your team's specific needs:

1. Open any `.mdc` file in the `.cursor/rules` directory
2. Modify the rules to match your specific requirements
3. Save the file and Cursor will immediately use the updated rules

## Rule Types

### Base Rules

The `base.mdc` file contains core development principles that apply to all code, regardless of technology:

- Code organization and naming conventions
- Error handling and logging
- Security principles
- Performance optimization
- Documentation standards

### Technology-Specific Rules

Other files contain rules tailored to specific technologies, such as:

- **aws-lambda.mdc** - Lambda function design and implementation
- **aws-dynamodb.mdc** - DynamoDB data modeling and access patterns
- **nextjs.mdc** - Next.js application architecture and components
- **react-native.mdc** - React Native mobile development

## Recommended Attachment Modes

For optimal AI guidance and performance, we recommend configuring these rules with specific attachment modes in Cursor IDE:

### Setting Up Attachment Modes

1. Open Cursor IDE
2. Go to Settings > Rules
3. Find each rule file and set its attachment mode as recommended below

### Recommended Configuration

| Rule Type | Recommended Mode | Explanation |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| **Core Rules** | Always | These fundamental rules should apply to all development |
| `base.mdc` | Always | Core development principles apply universally |
| `readme-documentation.mdc` | Always | Documentation standards should be consistent throughout |
| **Technology-Specific Rules** | Auto Attached or Agent Requested | These should only activate when relevant |
| AWS service rules | Auto Attached or Agent Requested | Provides AWS guidance only when working with related files |
| Web/mobile rules | Auto Attached or Agent Requested | Offers framework-specific advice when in relevant files |

This configuration ensures:
- **Consistent Standards**: Core best practices are always applied
- **Contextual Guidance**: Specialized rules appear only when relevant
- **Reduced Noise**: You won't get AWS advice when working on frontend code
- **Better Performance**: Reduces context size by only including pertinent rules

To manually override these settings for a specific interaction, you can use the Rules dropdown menu in the chat interface.

## Team Collaboration

For teams, we recommend:

1. **Centralize Rules** - Maintain rules in a dedicated repository
2. **Review Process** - Establish a process for reviewing and updating rules
3. **Automation** - Use the included GitHub workflow to sync rules across projects
4. **Documentation** - Document why certain rules exist to build understanding

## Validation Tools

This repository includes tools to validate and maintain your cursor rules:

1. **Rule Validator**: Ensures all rule files follow the correct format
   ```bash
   cd .github/scripts
   npm install
   node validate-rules.js
   ```

2. **Best Practice Checkers**: Scripts to check for updates to best practices
   ```bash
   node check-aws-best-practices.js
   node check-frontend-best-practices.js
   node check-mobile-best-practices.js
   ```

## GitHub Integration

The included GitHub workflow automates:

1. **Validation**: Ensures all rules follow the correct format
2. **Distribution**: Syncs rules to other repositories you maintain
3. **Updates**: Checks for new best practices and creates issues

## Compatibility

- Cursor IDE v0.45 or later (supports MDC format)
- Earlier versions can still use the `.cursorrules` format (deprecated)
